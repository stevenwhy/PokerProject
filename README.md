# PokerProject
This is a simple poker program that has an algorithm to draw new cards. 

It uses SFML to generate the UI.

The system will handle gambling with virtual money. 

Poker is against 3 AI and BlackJack is just against the house, or the dealer.

The ZIP file contains all three parts and the images for the cards.

If a certain part was not made by me, credit was given in the top of the source file.
